Binary Search Tree Algorithm
============================
Constructs a searchable Binary Tree out of an unsorted array

1. Class instance accepts an array as input.
2. Array is automatically sorted on initialize and the tree is built.
3. Tree is constructed from array items.
4. Each item becomes an instance of the Node class.
5. Tree can now be searched using one of three search methods.

SEARCH METHODS:
* breadth_first_search(query)
* depth_first_search(query)
* dfs_recursive(query) 

In this implementation, the input must be an array.  However, it shouldn't be too hard to write a method that allows us to search a hash as well.
